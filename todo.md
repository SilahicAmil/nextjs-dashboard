- Overall -----

  - Find a Color Pallete that works across the app
  - Probably need to learn some UI/UX for this
  - **Also add better error handling for APIs**

- USER PROFILE ----- (Need to implement this before I can add Owner Button)
  - Next auth should make this "EASY"
  - Add user profile component(s)
  - View notebook to see what user profile needs to look like
  - On user profile show only tickets owned by person
  - Add API route to fetch user data
  - **Figure out Next Auth**

* New Ticket ----- (Practically Done )

  - Add like 25-30 Character Title Limit maybe?
  - Description limit to like 150 characters maybe?

* Main Ticket Table -----

* Ticket Details ----- (Will Take The Most Time - Start Here)
  - Works on how to add files and retrieve from DB for download ability
  - Reply button should be likes a comments section
  - Modal of comments
  - Need new API route for this
  - fetch ticket comments in [ticketId] and pass to ticket details on click
  - Remove notes button
