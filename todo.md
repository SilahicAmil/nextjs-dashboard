- Overall -----

  - Find a Color Pallete that works across the app
  - Probably need to learn some UI/UX for this
  - Create hook(s) for fetching from DB - Check Web Dev Junkie for reminder

* NavBar -----
  - Need to find a better looking nav bar
  - DaisyUI probably has some poggers stuff
  - Wish they had a side nav sad face (might just make my own YOLO)

- USER PROFILE ----- (Need to implement this before I can add Owner Button)
  - Next auth should make this "EASY"
  - Add user profile component(s)
  - View notebook to see what user profile needs to look like
  - On user profile show only tickets owned by person
  - Add API route to fetch user data
  - Figure out Next Auth

* New Ticket ----- (Practically Done )

  - Add like 25-30 Character Title Limit maybe?
  - Description limit to like 500 characters maybe?

* Main Ticket Table -----

* Ticket Details ----- (Will Take The Most Time - Start Here)

  - Add claim button next to notes button - Redux/Context needed for this!
  - Update owner on main page ticket table based off claimed - Either Redux/Context
  - Fetch files in ticket

- Main Page -----
  - Add a landing page
  - Find inispiration from somewhere for this
  - ^ Just make sure it looks purdy
