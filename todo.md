- Overall -----

  - Find a Color Pallete that works across the app
  - Probably need to learn some UI/UX for this
  - **Create Loading States and Spinners for components - Mainly TicketTable and NewTicket**
  - **Also add better error handling for APIs**
  - **Re-Add .env for PROD and LOCAL**

* NavBar -----
  - Need to find a better looking nav bar
  - DaisyUI probably has some poggers stuff
  - Wish they had a side nav sad face (might just make my own YOLO)

- USER PROFILE ----- (Need to implement this before I can add Owner Button)
  - Next auth should make this "EASY"
  - Add user profile component(s)
  - View notebook to see what user profile needs to look like
  - On user profile show only tickets owned by person
  - Add API route to fetch user data
  - Figure out Next Auth

* New Ticket ----- (Practically Done )

  - Add Email field
  - Add like 25-30 Character Title Limit maybe?
  - Description limit to like 150 characters maybe?

* Main Ticket Table -----

* Ticket Details ----- (Will Take The Most Time - Start Here)

  - Add claim button next to notes button (right side - Look at SRT photos)
  - Show owner right next to claim button
  - Add reply button on bottom where attachments are
  - Redo the whole page so there is a split in the middle - Look at SRT photos
  - Works on how to add files and retrieve from DB for download ability
  - Add submitter name on left hand side of split ( Look at SRT photos)
  -

- Main Page -----
  - **Add a landing page**
  - Find inispiration from somewhere for this
  - ^ Just make sure it looks purdy
