- Overall -----
- Find a Color Pallete that works across the app
- Probably need to learn some UI/UX for this

- USER PROFILE ----- (Second Most Time Taker)

* Add user profile component(s)
* View notebook to see what user profile needs to look like
* On user profile show only tickets owned by person
* Add API route to fetch user data
* Figure out Next Auth

- New Ticket ----- (Practically Done - Finishing this first)

<!-- * Setup submitFormHandler with the new ticket API -->

- Add Limitation to number of characters allowed in title and description
- Move Form into a custom hook most likely
  <!-- * Add new ticket component(s) -->
  <!-- * Add API route for adding new ticket -->
  <!-- - View notebook on how new ticket form should look -->
  <!-- - Add Tier Dropdown - Tier C, Tier B, Tier A -->
  <!-- - Figure out of how attach files -->

* Main Ticket Table ----- (Third Most Time Taker)

<!-- * Fetch Owner (from context), Title, Tier, Ticket ID Only -->
<!-- * Add API to fetch ticket data -->

- Update owner on based off claimed in ticket details - Redux/Context
<!-- * Add New Job/ Ticket Button above table on main page -->
- Style New Job Button

* Ticket Details ----- (Will Take The Most Time - Start Here)

- Add ticket details component(s) - check whiteboard/notebook for layout
- Add API route for notes based off ticketId
- Add claim button to ticket details - Redux/Context needed for this!
- Update owner on main page ticket table based off claimed - Either Redux/Context
- Fetch files in ticket
