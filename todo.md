- Overall -----

  - Find a Color Pallete that works across the app
  - Probably need to learn some UI/UX for this

- USER PROFILE ----- (Need to implement this before I can add Owner Button)

  - Add user profile component(s)
  - View notebook to see what user profile needs to look like
  - On user profile show only tickets owned by person
  - Add API route to fetch user data
  - Figure out Next Auth

* New Ticket ----- (Practically Done )

  - Add Limitation to number of characters allowed in title and name
  - Description limit to like 500 characters maybe

* Main Ticket Table -----

  - Add claim button next to notes button - Redux/Context needed for this!
  - Update owner on main page ticket table based off claimed - Either Redux/Context
  - Fetch files in ticket
